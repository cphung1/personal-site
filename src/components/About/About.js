        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Full stack web developer with a background in education. While teaching elementary school students how to code, I found myself more drawn to what they were doing than what I was. This placed me in front of a tough choice- do I continue teaching or follow the intrigue into the coding world? Having taken a few classes in computer science, I knew it was something I enjoyed. So, I took the plunge, changed my career path, and havenâ€™t looked back.</p>
